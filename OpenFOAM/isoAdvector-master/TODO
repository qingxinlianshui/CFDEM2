- Make isoCutCell::vofCutCell that takes the cells vertices and vertex values as arguments, i.e. not using ap_
- Make isoCutCell::vofCutCell that takes a interface normal direction as input
- Investigate behaviour with cyclic BC
- Make a test application and case that sweeps a cell with a given interface normal or ap_.
- Implement consistent handling of isolated interface cells
- Implement new idea for interface normal orientation
- Implement handling of porous media where only a fraction of the cell volume and face area is available for fluid
- Handling of multiple interfaces in same cell
- Reduce the number of arguments of timeIntegratedFaceFlux by exploiting proportionality to dt, phi and by calculating pTimes on a cell basis prior to calling it
- Fix problem with absolute phi values in conditional statements in code (will cause ill behaviour for very small cells)
